# learningCSS

This repository is used for learning CSS using the course I downloaded - CSS The Complete Guide 2023 including Flexbox Grid &amp; Sass

## First Chapter - firstChp

This contains the general understanding and application of CSS combinators like

- Adjacent Sibling
  - h2+p : This means all `<p></p>` elements that are **directly adjacent** to `<h2></h2>` elements will be selected
- General Sibling
  - h2~p : This means all `<p></p>` elements that are on the **same level** as `<h2></h2>` elements will be selected
- Child
  - div>p :This means all `<p></p>` elements that are the **direct child** of `<div></div>` elements will be selected
- Descendant
  - div p :This means all `<p></p>` elements that are the **direct or indirect (one or more levels down) child** of `<div></div>` elements will be selected
